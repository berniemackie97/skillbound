Go to the Varrock center, talk to Baraek and pay him 20gp to progress Shield of Arrav (Phoenix clan) make sure to check all dialogue options. Make sure you have at least 3704 gp left after the next Aubury shopping trip. Go to Aubury, give him the research notes and buy 100 mind, 100 air, 50 water, 50 earth, 20 fire runes (no rune packs) . Speak with Dimintheis in Varrock East to start Family Crest. Head to Old Man Yarlo for Daddy's home and progress the miniquest to the point you collect the waxwood logs from the crates in the kitchen . Head south to the Phoenix hideout and talk to Straven to progress Shield of Arrav then head to the Blue Moon Inn, go upstairs and open the chest at the end of the hall, read the message (you can drop it after). Go back downstairs and kill Johnny the beard (with magic) and pick up the report. Talk to Dr Harlow to progress Vampyre Slayer, buy him a beer. Buy an extra beer for later. Go back to Straven, give him the report to get the Weapon store key. Grab half of the Shield of Arrav. From now on every time you are in Varrock you may complete Shield of Arrav with a partner, at your own convenience (sooner is better). Use clan chat \"osrs soa\" to find a partner. If you plan to join the Black Arm Gang: head southwest to Charlie the Tramp, speak with him, then enter the Black Arm Gang hideout to the west, speak with Katrine and progress the quest.",

      "description": "Do Wintertodt for a long time. If you want to get max stats in the most efficient manner continue until almost 99 firemaking , using the banked cakes for food. Your four warm items are the clue hunter garb, gloves and boots along with the rainbow scarf. If you wish to leave earlier to save some time this is fine. It is most efficient to do 'hoptodt' - hopping to a game where the wintertodt is around 60-70% energy, then fletching logs to get (just over) 500 points barely in time, getting the reward card and xp bonus, then hopping to the next world. This is highest firemaking xp and highest loot rolls/hr, but does require a plugin/stream/scout to find the wintertodt energy percentages on other worlds. Shortly after this step it is a goal to get to level 46 fletching, if you do hoptodt (instead of no-fletch single world or multiskilling in the bank between games) you will get most of this fletching xp from todt but if not you will need more gp for fletching supplies. You may prefer to leave some firemaking gap for using an infernal axe at redwoods later (not efficient, but very low effort). Each infernal axe used this way gives 5.7m woodcutting xp and 875k firemaking xp. Levels 90-99 is 7.7m xp. If you want to take this strategy, stop training FM at level 9 8 . Quests, random things, and 1.5 infernal axes at redwoods for 90-99 woodcutting will finish off 99 FM. We strongly recommend getting as many as possible of the fo llowing while at wintertodt: 128 k gp + 2.62 gp/xp for fletching (the goal is level 46, so 68k xp). While exactly 128k gp is enough, it is recommended to get a bit extra in case you unexpectedly need more runes or want to deviate. 60 woodcutting (higher is better, you will need 70 later and the rest will be trained with sulliusceps and 2t teaks outside Soul Wars). You can get this elsewhere too. Uncut rubies and emeralds, at least 50 each (more is better, you will have to buy up to ~120 rubies so if you go lower you need more gp down the line. They cost 1 k gp each, and emeralds cost 500 gp each ). 8 uncut sapphires (more is better). 16 magic logs (for Desert Treasure, Mourning's End Part I and Monkey Madness II. If you do not get enough you w ill need 75 woodcutting instead of 70). Note that you can only get magic logs by looting the reward cart after level 50 woodcutting, so don't open any rewards before that point! Furthermore, the chance of getting them massively increases at level 60 woodcutting. It is therefore recommended to only open the reward cart at level 60 woodcutting or higher . There is one more break point for opening the loot - after completing The Digsite quest, step 40 of chapter 1, getting better ores. Other skills and levels are not worth waiting for. The following logs for bird runs: 13 oak, 24 willow, 52 teak, 44 maple. 10 willow logs and 20 mahogany logs for the Varrock medium diary, 11 yew logs for the Ardougne medium diary, 1 yew log for the Desert hard diary, 1 oak, willow and maple log for Enakhra's Lament, 1 willow log for Icthlarin's Little Helper. About 10 regular logs for assorted use. Extra mahoganies and teaks are very welcome for construction. O ak logs to cut into headless arrows , to make arrow shafts for 46 fletching (only as many as needed - you will get 190 fletching xp per oak log). 3 more oak logs for Sleeping Giants (do not cut these into shafts) 30 construction (more is better, 30 is essential) 2 iron ore 1 silver ore 1 grimy ranarr weed 3 willow seeds 15 harralander seeds (or more lower tier herb seeds for similar xp) ~20 0 pure essence A raw swordfish (you can get this from tempoross later) . Some silver and gold ore (~50 silver, ~100 gold is sufficient, more is better. If you don't get enough you may have to buy some at the blast furnace later). Some fletching levels along the way (the guide will assume level 31, 15,500 xp, after this step, if you are over/under you can adjust your future plans for making steel arrows to 46 fletching accordingly). Optionally: do a small group kill on a separate world for 3000 or more points in one game for the Combat Achievement. Quite a few people worry about minmaxing the loot. It doesn't matter that much, training skills up for better loot is not worth it. The optimal way to open reward carts is: Wait until 60 woodcutting to open any rewards . If you are not staying at todt until 60wc instead open them as late as possible (when you leave todt). If you do wait until 60wc, open all but 30-50 of them. If you have remaining reward cart pulls after the above step, wait until you have completed the Digsite quest to open the rest. Do not wait for other levels (herblore, farming, etc.) with collecting the rewards. If you have more rewards then collect them as soon as you can use the loot . In particular, do not wait for 'breakpoints' in levels to increase your loot, just open them for money to reduce time spent blackjacking. You can optionally decide to wait for completion of step 93 (tithe farming) to increase the seed yield, but this is not best. After opening all of the rewards, we assume that you have exactly 128k GP as a baseline, as well as the money for 46 fletching. HCIM will need a bit more (get 200k to be safe).",

Run south and buy one of each mould in Dommik's Crafting Store shop including tiara but not bolt, plus a second necklace mould, along with 3 needles and 10 thread, then some mithril platelegs. Go east , start and complete Sleeping Giants. Buy 9 bronze bars in the Shantay Pass, along with two sets of desert clothes (one pair of boots only), 5 Shantay passes, 16 bucket packs, 20 buckets of water, 4 bowls of water and 10 waterskins. Make 4 soft clay while you're at the bank chest. Make sure to bring 5 buckets for Ugthanki dung and wear leather gloves during the following quests. Note: the following quests can be multiquested, but for the sake of inventory space and convenience it is fine to do Tourist Trap completely, then do The Feud after.

If you have enough poor rng to hit 17 or higher magic you can use bolt spells to improve your chances. Carry chaos runes for bolt spells here! Complete The Tourist Trap, put both xp rewards on agility. Return to Ali Morrisane and complete The Feud.

Note: blackjac king has a high fail rate at low level, and this step is unpleasant. It gets much better around level 55-60, so hang in there. OSRS blackjacking (270k xp/h) this is the general method, only slown on the higher level bandits here but the setup is the same.

B uy 1600 soda as h and 10 buckets of slime (if it is competitive or bought out, charter to Catherby and buy them there), 10/world at a time. Charter a ship to Catherby. Buy steel arrowtips to round out 46 fletching (if you don't have that level yet) . We recommend buying 250 tips/world to save hopping but if you are low on gp you can buy 100/world instead to save some cash here . Take out a knife from the bank and a light source (grab a candle along the way and light it with a tinderbox if you don't have any). Grab insect repellant, collect two buckets of wax and five flax (diary) and speak with Sherlock (diary). Enter the Temple of Ikov and grab some Boots of Lightness, then leave again. Start Merlin's Crystal up to the step where you need to visit Arhein. Run to Seers, grab the f ishing pass and other items for fishing contest from the bank . Continue Fishing Contest to the step where you get the trophy. Fly fish north of Seers bank to 35 fishing, banking the fish . Complete Murder Mystery while training (start the quest, get all relevant clues in the mansion, fish an inv, bank, do the relevant steps in the village, resume the quest etc .). Home telepor t to Lumbridge, cross the gate to Al-Kharid (costs 10gp), run south and speak with Hassan to start Prince Ali Rescue, then Osman to resume the quest. R un south and board Ferryman Sathwood's ferry. Train fishing at mass world Tempoross to level 56. It is most efficient to cook the harpoonfish instead of using them raw. Make sure to only cash in the reward permits after you have hit level 50 fishing - this is a significant boost to your loot! From here on add steel arrowtips to your headless arrows as you move, to get level 46 fletching. You can make a fire underneath yourself to tick manipulate cook-fish fly fish ( https://streamable.com/90mz74 ), but beware that you want to bank some trout for quests and salmon for food for later. Note that you need at least 15 cooking for this, so you will need to train some cooking on the side, for example buying raw f ish from Gerrant in Port Sarim, to make this work. If you went all the way to 99 firemaking, and therefore also made at least 99000 gp in excess of the amount you needed at WT, make a detour to Ignatius Vulcan when picking flax and buy the Firemaking cape. This has some uses both as a light source and for defensive stats, but mostly it is just iconic. Tempoross will also give random amounts of planks, nails, raw fish, gold bars, gems and other loot that will be useful later. None of these are required but all of them will help down the line. There are several Combat Achievement tasks for Tempoross. It is recommended (but fine if you don't) to complete as many of the easy and medium tier as you can during this Tempoross grind. Optionally you can stay for the fish barrel. It is a good item for barbarian fishing and for buying karambwans (Brimhaven POH method https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDkz186YgME ), some people also use it to fish karambwans (lowering the rate in exchange for longer trips, i.e. making it more afk). Staying for a fish barrel is not recommended. Solo methods for Tempoross exist, but they are difficult at low level and not recommended.",

If you want/need more rewards from forestry instead do this on a forestry world - you likely can't 2t there as people kill the birds. Use fairy ring BJP to get there - either using a necklace of passage to the wizards' tower, or swapping to the Arceuus spellbook (once) then using the Salve graveyard teleport spell . You can also keep doing hourlies and returning to the teak trees this way. If you did not get 16 magic logs from Wintertodt keep going to level 75 instead. You c an also go to 75 regardless if you want, it's ~EHP. Remember to swap to the normal spellbook on completion if you chose Arceuus during this step. Wear armour and take a few food to survive the birds and stay for a long time. When doing bird runs , do sulliusceps to get 5 sulliuscep caps (note: this can take a long time, long enough to cover multiple bird run timers). Take food, a rake and antipoison. Note: you may be able to get away with fewer than 5 caps and save some time here, but this is a bit of a gamble. Optional: train to 75 woodcutting (if you haven't already) and on a future tree run collect magic roots to make an amulet of nature to improve your farming contracts and herb runs on kronos. 2t Woodcutting Prif with moving shows how to move between trees without messing up the 2t setup. The same strategy works at Soul Wars. Alternatively, use 2t oak cutting to train your woodcutting, see e.g. Getting Rats for 2t Oaks , though keeping the rats in cycle while burning the logs may prove difficult. At your own convenience (recommended: right now) chop 300 oak and willow logs and purchase the log basket from the forestry shop.",

It's probably smart to finish 80 dragons instead in case of bad RNG at the Wilderness altar. Make sure to bank at least one spare set of dragon bones. For using the bones up, run from Ferox Enclave). After this step, the game is safe. :) HCIM: There are three options for HCIM, and they are all bad: Do the above step but kill more dragons, using the ectofuntus to turn them in. Ghosts Ahoy is only in Ch2St22, so either you do this without an ectophial (fairy ring ALQ on Arceuus book, dueling rings to rebank), or you reroute to complete the quest early. There are no significant requirement for doing the quest early. Instead of killing green dragons, you can safespot blue dragons in the Isle of Souls. They are way tankier and this takes considerably more time, but it means you don't have to go into the wilderness. Taverley Dungeon is not viable right now with 51 agility. Varlamore mining: mining calcified rocks gives blessed bone shards, which can be turned in at the liberation bowl with blessed wine (made from regular wine) starting at level 30 prayer - which you have. The downside is that this method scales significantly with mining level, so it's lousy right now (but it is completely safe). Later, when going for 70 prayer, this is a reasonable alternative for HCIM to wildy green dragons, though it is still recommended to train mining more as much as possible before doing this method.",

      "description": "Do t ithe farming until you have level 62. This should give you the points to buy herb sack , autowee d and the seed box points. Level 62 is perfect for starting boosting (garden pies from the chef's guild, and later in Cam Torum) medium farming contracts. This level may be enough to get you seed box as well, and if not you could choose to stay a bit longer to buy that item as well. Go to the farming guild (games neck to wintertodt into minecart), get your first contract and preplant all other patches (if necessary go pickpocket master farmers for seeds). Maintain farming contracts as much as possible. You will need a whiteberry soon, so make sure to grow a whiteberry bush. While your farming is level 51-53 you can use garden pies to boost for Bologano seeds (takes approximately 6-7 pies total for these levels depending on the method) to significantly increase your xp. If you ever run out of garden pies, buy some more. Farming contracts begin here. The fastest and most efficient way to get to the farming guild is using the Kourend library teleport on the Arceuus spellbook or games necklace to wintertodt into the minecart to the farming guild , blowing glass or fletching arrow shafts/headless arrows as you move. On your first trip to the Farming guild, first travel to the North side outside the guild and chop mahogany logs for the diary step. If you downgrade into a farming contract you do not have the seeds for the best way to get some is by pickpocketing master farmers. Preplanting and skipping contracts that take a long time (>3 hours for medium tier) to complete is an extremely good strategy to increase your contracts completed per day, see also the (hard contract, but applicable to medium contracts as well) flow chart in the contracts section of the farming guide below. The first time you go to the farming guild, grab six yellow dyes and seven red dyes from the shelves in the Getting Ahead farm. Mix one yellow and red dye to make an orange dye. Amateur h erb runs begin here - meaning herb runs where you only visit the herb patches that are easy to access. Right now that is just the Morytania patch (Fenkenstrain teleport) and Varlamore patch (fairy ring AJP - though it is also completely fine to disregard this patch entirely), and soon you will add the Falador patch (Explorer's ring teleport). M ake sure to farm as soon as reasonably possible: 22 limpwurt roots (one is for the strength potion easy Kourend diary step, complete it at your convenience using the Kharedst's teleport and then complete the easy diary, putting the xp on Herblore. Another is for the Varrock medium diary step. Make sure to plant at least one in Catherby for the diary) W hiteberries (in either the Champions ' Guild , the Farming Guild patch or the Ardougne Monastery patch). Two toadflax for agility potions (for Tai Bwo Wannai Trio and Making Friends with My Arm). On one of your (future) herb runs plant strawberries in Ardougne for the diary (both patches recommended). You will need some prayer potions soon, so make sure to plant a set of ranarrs and snape grass early as well. Plant watermelons to harvestfill for making more compost. Growing harralanders for making energy potions is very reasonable, and they will come in handy. Grow at least 20 nightshade for the Seren fight in Song of the Elves. You won't need this for a long time, but you may as well grow them early! If you worry you might not one-shot the fight, get 30-40 of them instead. Note: until you get to Chapter 2, Step 66 you will be stuck with 'amateur' herb runs as the best herb run option. It is recommended to postpone herb runs until that step, while maintaining farming contracts and other hourlies. If you find you need herblore levels, potions or want to do herb runs anyway, check the farming guide linked below and ignore patches that are difficult to reach (on the Arceuus spellbook), doing runs with fewer patches instead. This means, for example, only visiting the Falador farming patch as many times per day as you have explorer's ring teleports. Until Chapter 2, Step 66 all mentions of herb runs refer to optional, low efficiency herb runs. When you get palm tree seeds, make sure to plant your first in Brimhaven and second outside the Tree Gnome Village. When you get yew tree seeds, make sure to plant one in Varrock after level 68 farming and 60 woodcutting, to dig up for two yew roots for the diary. Based on our estimates you will need to complete around 200-250 farming contracts (starting with medium, downgrading if you roll something slow) to bank the herbs for level 70 using Barblore later. Even if you aren't ready to farm the herbs yet it is worth collecting the seeds. If you are asked to complete a contract that you would like to do but for which you don't have the seeds it is worth to pickpocket master farmers for a bit (for example in Draynor or north of Ardougne) to get it. The loot scales with your farming level (and the failure chance with your thieving level), but according to this Mod Ash tweet the farming scaling only has an impact on the ranarr, snapdragon and torstol rates so the other seeds are fine. https://twitter.com/JagexAsh/status/1400868684474765314 Save 6 spirit tree seeds to plant across the world and in your POH (also keep in mind that they can get diseased and die while growing), trade all others in for t5 farming contracts. Once you hit level 85 (boostable) farming you can plant Celastrus saplings, and harvest them for bark which makes battlestaves. If you want a bit more leeway with GP you can harvest and replant these at the end of the day/when you won't be doing farming contracts for the next 13 hours or so even if you're not on a contract. You should typically have a ton of seeds by the time you can plant them. If you are ever low on money you can alch the staves from celastrus harvests 'raw', or blow and charge more orbs for them . This is particularly relevant for HCIM, who might chicken out of wish to avoid killing green dragons in the wilderness later and then lack green d'hide bodies gp. Once you hit level 58 herblore, go back to Tithe farm to buy the herb sack. The best method to do Tithe farming at this level is 25x4 Half-Replant Gricoller's Tithe Farm! Fastest XP (~120k xp/hr) but using regular watering cans - no need to buy Gricoller's can. Also you can left click to water the plants, it is not necessary to manual click water except on the first lap, immediately after planting . This may use energy potions at your agility level, despite the agility rework making it much more doable. As an alternative there is 20x5: Tithe Farm Updated (100 fruits in 19min 24sec - No Stams/Energy potions) . You can find a complete farming guide here: 20220622FarmingGuide . It is more accurate and complete than the farming advice scattered throughout BRUHsailer. Please use this to plan your farming methods going forward. This guide also has videos and resources on tithe farming.",

Short guide to low level earth orbs: Run to the earth obelisk with 25 unpowered orbs a feather, rock cake (or enchanted symbol), paddewwa tab to get there and 3 valuable items (dueling ring, games neck, earth staff recommended. Throughout this method you will keep your gravestone up, so make sure you always have at least one item (the feather) in there! Never collect the feather unless you're done with this step. Rock cake down to low health and die to Chronozon or the poison from a spider (at the narrow entrance) at the earth obelisk. Teleport to the bank (if you do the entire process on a PvP world you are already at a bank chest and can skip that teleport). Sip an antipoison in the bank (to prevent poison splats from the spider interrupting your charging. Alternatively, you can have a skeleton/black demon attack you and run past while the spiders cannot attack). Grab a looting bag, cosmic runes, paddewwa tab, 25 unpowered orbs (24 + Wizard Mind Bomb if needed). Break the tab, run to the earth obelisk, charge all the orbs, put them in the looting bag, grab your orbs from the gravestone (leave one item in the gravestone!) , charge them, teleport out to Castle Wars/Ferox and bank. Grab your 3 valuable items and 27 orbs, teleport to corporeal beast and have him kill you. Note: do NOT purchase an instance, this will cost 100k with no upside. Go to step 2. This video shows a (different) high level method with an edgeville respawn point, the above is a low-level alternative Improved Gravestone Air Orb Charging Once done, collect any leftover orbs from death's office. Optional: charge an air orb for the diary, boosting with a Wizard's Mind Bomb.",

Feel free to get the level instead, if you want). Buy the ancient staff from Eblis. Once done, head south (rebank at the Ruins of Unkah if needed), kill Jackals and Vultures for Rag and Bone Man II and desert diary. Do Enakhra's Lament. You can do Enakhra's Lament before mining the sandstone, so you can refill your pouches at the fountain inside the temple (camulet teleport). This is faster and also gives you a good opportunity to do hourlies. Keep in mind you now have to go to 3k xp from level 60 with mining sandstone. You need to carry some waterskins for the mining, refilling them at Unkah as necessary. Previously there was a gravestone method, but currently it does not work. 3 tick sandstone mining at new spot (easier method) shows the 3t4s method (also linked above). https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwLJm_Zu0ro by 5th hcim LUL shows how to do 3s1g - an older high xp tick manipulation sandstone mining method that does not require stamina potions, increasing mining xp/hr but getting less sand. Optional and recommended (but not assumed in the detailed XP sheet): mine 25k sand total for good low level mining xp, leaving the sand in the grinder. This gets you well past 60 mining. Now that you are level 60 mining you can solo the lowest level shooting stars that fell. One option to find one is to hop worlds, especially f2p worlds, on a location where the stars might fall. 20220129_09-16-40CrandorTilesSeeingBothFallenStars.png on Crandor is such a spot.

Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking for RFD/Awowogei. You can get to the fishing spot by using the Arceuus Library teleport (the Arceuus spell, not the Kharedst's) into the minecart to get back. This is faster than the Kharedst's to Lovakengj. Example setup here - the gp predates the Zeah favour rework and is not necessary. Cut-eat the fish for cooking xp, you will need at least level 70 cooking later. If you decide not to, then you'll have to do Mess Hall, which is slower. For an explanation on the Mount Quidamortem barblore (can be afked, just bank the sturgeons), see 20230127LowLevelBarblore . Warning: this document is several years out of date, and just covers the basic idea. Maintain cats, bird runs, contracts and (hardwood and fruit) tree runs, and optionally also include herb runs. Collect misc for mahogany logs for bird runs whenever necessary. If you run out of/low on digsite pendants go buy ~80 more rubies in a gem shop (Ardougne/Kourend pre completing Moons of Peril, Cam Torum after as it is cheaper and closer to a bank). If you prefer to do this as a low effort/afk activity you may instead choose to weave the fishing in during other steps (instead of grinding this all at once). The levels are not needed until step 64 of this chapter . Depending on your fishing rate your 2 weeks of Misc could be over during this step, make sure to take out the remaining GP at that point (or on some future step, whenever it happens). If you run out of soul runes go buy 200 more for teleports(/hourlies).",

Do low level group Volcanic Mine (this is a bit of a trek) for the prospector hat, and optionally for the rest of the gear as well. Check out https://discord.gg/FXPUrUp for finding teams. Complete the Falador hard diary step. Complete the Falador easy diary, putting the lamp on slayer. At MLM after hourlies you can run back from the Falador patch after a herb run, or use the Arceuus Spawn Point teleport to get back to Falador. Similar to the barbarian fishing you can choose to spread this out over multiple steps, although this time you need at least 72 mining by step 64 and you need to have completed MLM by step 73. If you think the coal and gem bag are not useful enough you can instead opt to first get ~68-70 mining through other means (in particular, sandstone or blast mining). This option will mean you will be short on gp and have to make a set of air staves from scratch to adjust. There is a tick manipulation method to significantly increase the speed of Motherload Mine (credit to Port Khazard and Drgn for discovering this). You can find a short example clip of this here: https://imgur.com/a/UkY7Ytj (the clip has a metronome sound for timing). The method works as follows: You need an adamant pickaxe, other tiers don't work. The method, explained below in more detail, works the same way you would 3t mine (e.g. 3s1g, or granite) but on a successful mine, click the next ore again on the xp drop, so that the total cycle is 4t on a success and 3t on a failure. Note that 'click' here means 'click processed on this tick', so you have to give the input 1t earlier. tick 1: herb tar rock 1t away tick 2: interact tick 3: still interacting tick 4: herb tar rock 1t away (does nothing if succeeded) - this is the tick 1 of the next cycle if you failed tick 5: click same rock u did in tick 4 (incase you succeeded) - this is the tick 1 of the next cycle if you succeeded Theoretically this represents an increase of approximately 40% in xp/hr at level 70 mining, though realistically the gains will be lower due to having to move to a new spot more often. OSRSMLMMotherlodeMineSpot.png shows a recommended location (in the southwest corner) for having multiple veins close to one another. Alternatively you can pick a closer spot to the deposit chute but have to adapt more to veins depleting. 3t/4t (3.5t?) double roll motherlode mine example shows the method in full, with an explanation in the description of the video. Tick manip Motherlode Mine example shows a non-optimised example clip, slightly north of the recommended spot. Your ~11 days of Misc should be more than over by now (they probably were a long time ago), make sure to take out the remaining GP (fill up the cash stack to at least 200k total) if you haven't already even if the time hasn't passed.",

The standard setup (with or without dragonfire potions) is: Helm of Neitiznot (risked), Dragon Scimitar, Dragon Defender, Amulet of Strength, Barrows gloves (+1), Proselyte top + bottom, Berserker Ring (i), Ardougne Cloak 1, Climbing Boots, Rada's Blessing 1, Resurrect Superior Skeletal/Ghostly thrall runes (unless you have access to the Greater spell at level 76, boostable from 73 with a Wizard's Mind Bomb. If so, use that instead) and book. Use a games necklace to Corporeal Beast then run east to get to the dragons (1250 or 1500 total level worlds are usually empty), and dueling rings back to Ferox to bank and restore. The example setup looks like this , although you may not need as much food. The best strategy for completing the Knight Wave Training Grounds is not flinching or poison, but simply fighting them using food and potions and letting the knights kill you once you run low on supplies. This will let you continue at the knight that killed you, making it very easy. The minigame is safe so HCIM can use this method too. This will get your defence to 70 (and, once you use the bones on the Chaos Altar, also prayer to 70), unlocking Piety. At some point your stats are high enough you might be within reach of completing the easy tier of the Combat Achievements, giving you a quick 5k xp lamp for a skill of your choice (probably herblore). HCIM: you can opt to train through calcified rocks in Varlamore instead, offering blessed bone shards at the liberation bowl. Note that this scales with your mining level, so optionally you could choose to do more mining (sandstone, granite or gem rocks) first.",

      "description": "Catch ~1.5k grey chins for level 55 ranging (at Soul Wars - you can take an axe to chop the nearby teaks in case you mess up your knife-log). Catch ~1.5k red chins between Kastori and Tal Teklan ( TalTeklanChinSpot.png ) . Follow this guide for catching chins: OSRS Easy 1t Hunter Guide (In-Depth) for the methods (regardless of location and chin type). Train your ranging in the MM1 tunnels (short fuse) to level 62 (55 with grey, 55-62 with red). Make sure to equip a salve amulet (ei). Optional alternative: skip this step and AFK the range training at crabs, you can even go to 70 but it is not really worth going beyond that. Second optional alternative: after getting 50 ranging with either method, do A Night at the Theatre to lamp Ranging four times (80k xp total), then use either method to train to level 62 after. You will probably need someone to carry you for A Night at the Theatre, but this is going to be true even if you go at some later point. If you have the herblore level to make ranged pots go and teleport one inventory of zamorak wines and make them all into potions, repotting frequently while chinning. Buy an upgraded device from Ava at level 50 (worth leaving for). At level 60 you can equip your mixed hide boots. Osrs 1 Def Pure Chinning guide and Experience rates and OSRS Pure Chinning Guide (Maximizing XP rates) show the mm1 tunnel method, though it is better to use a spot one curve deeper into the cave. The best location is shown (poorly) in this image . Optional: go do the Fight Caves for a fire cape. It will take quite a long time to get one, so we recommend getting one on step 27 of Chapter 3 instead. But if you feel confident and want one soon, this is the best moment. You will be doing floor 3 runs until 82 agility. Along the way you want to loot certain coffins for hallowed marks and generic loot. It is optional but recommended to continue all the way to 98 agility instead. The following coffins are recommended: On floor 3, loot the enchantment obstacle (only on the ONE side, 20240224_F3_Enchant_West.png , so on 50% of all runs). With a Hallowed focus (costs 100 hallowed marks) you will never fail the enchant and it will default to the lowest level enchantment spell you have on you. Without one the fail rate depends on the level of the spell and it will default to the highest one you have on you. It is recommended to use lvl-5 enchant before you have the focus, and lvl-3 enchant after. The XP gained for each spell is the same, regardless of level. On floor 3 each side has a grapple ( 20240224_F3_Grapple_West.png , 20240224_F3_Grapple_East.png ). You may choose to loot these right from the start, but failing them loses a lot of time. If you collect the Hallowed grapple (costs 100 hallowed marks) it is optional but not recommended to loot these until level 82 to speed up getting other loot. Floors 1-2 are not worth looting, although if you are chasing collection log slots you have to loot these too. 20240224_F2_Grapple_West.png for floor 2 and see below for floor 1. If you are using mahogany planks with rune nails (in BRUHsailer you will not be doing this) to build bridges it is efficient construction xp to build the bridge in floor 1 (on two out of four sides, so on 50% of all runs, 20240224_F1_Bridge_Coffin_West.png ) but not to cross it. Alternatively this is required if you are hunting the collection log slots. Based on the above, the recommended order for purchasing the Hallowed items is Focus > Instances > Ring > Hammer > Grapple. If you have banked vampyre ashes it is worth buying the Hallowed symbol and using them on floor 4 only. It is not efficient to collect vampyre ashes. You may always buy a few Hallowed tokens in case of a terrible run, so that you may finish it in time (and buy new tokens after). You will be doing Fletchp alch re (fletching headless arrows and casting high alchemy while moving at sepulchre). Feel free to bring the herb sack and plank sack. Maintain hourlies. It is also possible to blow glass inside the sepulchre, this is even more efficient than other multiskilling options. Most of the time is spent alching, not fletching. Once you have a little bit of cash restart misc to get teak logs for planks for building bridges (2400 total, 8 days). 10 teak 5 herb(/other) at Misc, along with 10 mahog 5 herb(/other) for future bird runs if you run low/out. Keep in mind that changing the Miscellania allocation works retroactively. Keep misc running even if you have enough planks for Sepulchre. Once you have enough planks, swap to 10 mahogany 5 herb(/other) for future construction training. As your cash stack grows just dump 7.5m in there (we will assume this going forward). You will only need these teak planks by the time you hit 82 agility, not before then. The recommended way to make planks is the Aubunvale sawmill, running between bank and sawmill using a log basket and a plank sack to make two inventories at a time.

      "description": "Note: if you are not planning to max you can reduce this step, although the lack of prayer potions might prove to be an issue for slayer later. You will also need to obtain more planks and train construction at your own convenience if you do not go to at least level 96 agility during this step. That being said, 98 agility at Sepulchre is a loooong grind, so give serious consideration to reducing/splitting it. Read this step in its entirety carefully. This step contains a huge Hallowed Sepulchre grind. After level 82 agility you are good for a while, but there is no real reason not to continue at Sepulchre. It is optional but recommended to continue all the way to 98 agility. The following coffins are recommended: Floor 4 has a bridge (only on ONE side, 20240224_F4_Bridge.png so on 50% of all runs). With a Hallowed hammer you will never break nails while attempting to build this bridge, and it is highly recommended to buy this hammer before reaching level 82 agility. Floor 4 has an enchantment obstacle (only on ONE side, 20240224_F4_Enchant_and_Bridge.png so on 50% of all runs). This is efficient to loot barring exceptionally lucky circumstances - in practice this is always worth looting. The enchant works identically to that on floor 3. Floor 5 always has an enchantment obstacle 20240224_F5_Enchant.png , a grapple obstacle 20240224_F5_Grapple.png and a bridge obstacle 20240224_F5_Bridge.png , followed by a grand coffin 20240224_F5_Grand_Coffin.png . Every single one of these is efficient to loot. Floors 1-3 are not worth looting anymore, although if you are chasing collection log slots you have to loot these too. If you are using mahogany planks with rune nails (in BRUHsailer you will not be doing this) to build bridges it is efficient construction xp to build the bridge in floor 1 (on two out of four sides, so on 50% of all runs, 20240224_F1_Bridge_Coffin_West.png ) but not to cross it. The enchant on f3 is the best of the technically inefficient looting options, so if you want to increase your loot a little this is the one to include in your runs. You will be doing Fletchp alch re (fletching headless arrows and casting high alchemy while moving at sepulchre) all the way to 98 agility. Feel free to bring the herb sack and plank sack. Maintain hourlies. It is also possible to blow glass inside the sepulchre, this is even more efficient than other multiskilling options. Most of the time is spent alching, not fletching. After Misc is up and running, buy arrow shafts and headless arrows (in smaller chunks) to get to a total of 1 million headless arrows through fletchpalchre. Alch (all) rune bolts for good magic xp along the way. We recommend buying the initial helpful items first and then spending a lot of hallowed marks on hallowed crystal shards (the teleports). Doing this for levels 82- 98 will on average grant the following loot and xp: ~24.5m gp (not including the costs for fletching, nature runes, planks etc) 565k thieving xp, 444k construction xp, ~600k fletching xp and 3.2m magic xp (primarily through alchs). 6.1k cosmic runes (these are useful for enchanting bracelets for gp and jewellery for general use later) 8.1k death runes 44.7k law runes (these serve no long term purpose but can be used to fill a nexus, for example) 44.7k blood runes (a good initial stack for barraging during slayer) 44.7k soul runes (these have some uses for Arceuus and barrage spells, as well as being required for Tumeken's Shadow eventually) 12.7k adamant bolts (next to useless) 1100 monkfish 102 prayer potions (4) 336 sanfew serums (4) (useful at DKS and the nightmare) 152 grimy ranarr weeds 336 ranarr seeds (~2.0k (4)-dose prayer potions when farmed, a good starting supply for slayer) 72 strange lockpicks (for Barrows later, although the meta is to only do a little bit of barrows, using around 5-10 lockpicks) 2.12 Rings of Endurance (88% chance to get at least one) 16.2k hallowed teleport crystals - this is more teleports than you will likely use for banking on the road of all activities combined to maxing, so instead it is a good idea to partially save the hallowed marks (e.g. for future updates, potentially amylase) or spend it on loot sacks. If you want a change of pace you can afk mine daeyalt essence for runecrafting later. There is also a high effort daeyalt (\"dae-alch\") method: https://streamable.com/it7kry . You can do this grind in smaller parts, or quit entirely at a lower agility level. Example setup here. You can use Parasailer's Hallowed Sepulchre calculator: 20240115 Hallowed Sepulchre: Looting to check your loot, xp, material requirements etc. and customise your strategy. A few notes: This calculator only works for levels 82+, and does not include f1 bridge building for xp. If you wish to build this bridge adjust the number of bridges per run afterwards manually. The sheet is default set to sell law and soul runes. To fix this go into the 'High' tab (bottom left) and uncheck the boxes for selling those runes. The floor 4 brazier, 20240224_F4_Ash_Coffin.png , is not recommended as it is not efficient to collect the ash in the first place. If you already have some this is the best use for it though, after buying the hallowed symbol.",

      "description": "Train slayer to get to 100cb. Your target stats are 78 Attack, 85 Strength, 75(+) Defence and 72(+) prayer, which should probably give you 78(+)Hitpoints and ~75 Slayer around the time you hit 100cb. Keep Strength around 10-15 levels ahead of Attack until it hits 83. At level 75 Attack make Arclight. Generally you only use accurate/aggressive/shared and get your bulk defence xp from defensive cast barrage tasks. Use piety whenever you're using melee. If you get an amulet of glory from dragon imps along the way use it for magic slayer tasks, not melee ones. Unlock Broader Fletching. If you happen to get to a good slayer point situation, purchase the slayer helmet and complete the Desert Hard diary. At level 90 magic you can use divine magic potions to stay at level 94 for entire (barrage) tasks and use ice barrage, if not you'll have to use smoke barrage for ankou/dust devils and ice burst for dagannoths. Make sure to cast the spells on defensive. Check out 20251019SlayerGuide for advice on efficient slayer at this point. If you (somehow) do not have runes for thralls or barrage, buy them. Use your Pharaoh's sceptre to teleport to the ancient magicks pyramid (Jaldraocht) to swap to the ancient spellbook when needed, and your POH Dark altar to swap to Arceuus when needed. When your sceptre is at 1 charge teleport to Pyramid Plunder (Jalsavrah) with 6 gold artefacts to recharge it to 25 charges. At your own convenience, complete the quest While Guthix Sleeps along the way. Grab the 100 magic logs during the quest for Shades of Mort'ton (for bloodbark) later. Alternatively, postpone the quest until after the Corrupted Gauntlet. Along the way you will hit milestones for the following diaries, complete them at your convenience along the way, putting all lamps on herblore: At any point: save a shield left half (if you get one) for the Ardougne Hard diary 62 slayer - Kourend Hard diary 68 slayer - Wilderness Hard diary 72 slayer - Falador Hard diary Slayer Helmet - Desert Hard diary This also requires killing the Kalphite Queen. One of the more efficient ways to do this is by using thralls only, since this also completes the Combat Achievements task of only attacking with a Verac's Flail. See 0 HP XP Kalphite Queen (Thralls) OSRS or OSRS 'Prayer Smasher' Elite Combat Achievement - Without Verac's Flail for example kills. Keep in mind you need to splash all the grasp attacks. 100 combat level - Karamja Hard diary After completing the Karamja Hard diary, mine gems in the underground gem mine, cut them in the bank, sell them for trading sticks at Gabooty (10 opal/10 jade/1 red topaz per world, wear your Karamja gloves ) to get 100k trading sticks. In total this takes 520 cut opals, 520 cut jades and 52 red topazes (keep additional red topaz and a good amount of opals for slayer bracelets. Buy to a total of 10k karambwans at Tiadeche (using a Ring of Endurance, Vile Vigour and three client hopping for the best rates), banking with Rionasta's parcel service. Video: Shopscape Karambwans . Do the Kourend & Kebos Hard diary (lamp on RC), then cook the karambwans at your convenience (1t cooking at the Hosidius range is best, cooking gauntlets do not work on karambwans).

Follow this guide for catching chins: OSRS Easy 1t Hunter Guide (In-Depth) . If you want to catch red chinchompas but the Varlamore spot is too competitive, e.g. with bots, the second best option is catching them northeast of Prifddinas. Throw the chins in the cave to get to 70 ranging, complete the Western Provinces Hard Diary (this involves getting one Zulrah kill), upgrade your void to Elite, (optionally: grab an offtask fire cape at some point along the way), return and throw the chins to get to level 92 ranging. Make sure to use ranging potions and a bonecrusher (with at least 24k charges), your elite void ranged, mixed hide boots, a berserker ring (i), an amulet of strength, a crystal halberd for speccing, a mixed hide cape and carry death charge runes. Also note that chins are not lost in death, so you could carry more and extend the trip. Use medium fuse.

Example setup for Zulrah diary kill , using blood barrage(/blitz). https://streamable.com/l64fsw example kill. Pre-99 Chinchompa Calculator for checking the numbers. If you want to go for a lower ranged level https://i.imgur.com/j291MJI.png shows the max hits of the corrupted bow (t3 bow in the corrupted gauntlet) by level with eagle eye, levels 89 and 87 are reasonable alternative stopping points. This will make CG more difficult and slower and also reduce your max hits once you do get the bow though. If you do not want to train with chinchompas (which are best by far) you could alternatively afk it in the nightmare zone. The nightmare zone has super ranging pots, making it the best afk ranged training method by far. The recommended afk range NMZ method is: Wear (elite) void, a magic shortbow (i), rune arrows, amulet of glory, shayzien boots (5). Use the Hawk Eye (10%) prayer, no overhead. Rock cake(/DS2 orb) down to 1hp, use absorption potions, repeat this approximately every 6-9 minutes (it's fine to go to higher health in between and lose more absorption charges, the goal is to have it afk. Some other guides will recommend resetting every minute or flicking rapid heal, this is a waste of time). Use the super ranging potions (duh), resetting along with the rock cake + absorption pots + prayer pot sips (for hawk eye). Use hard custom rumble (not standard!). Bitterkoekje's DPS Calculator has a tab for NMZ DPS on set 1, so verify for yourself. Generally the recommended list of enemies is: Moss Giant Sand Snake Count Draynor King Roald Witch's Experiment (this choice might depend on level, use the DPS calculator to verify). Optional and not recommended: you could detour for a zombie axe from armoured zombies at Zemouregal's Fort (the higher level ones are better) with barrage spells, then use that along with a rune crossbow at the Royal Titans, specifically Eldric the Ice King, with the goal of unlocking the Deadeye prayer. This allows you to reduce the ranged level target from 92 to 89. Alternatively, you can knock out this scroll (and the other one) after CG, getting much faster kills.",

Make some staminas for future use. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuqyCbHuxu8 (newest force spawning marks of grace example video). Older sources: Force spawning marks of grace on Ardy rooftop and Force Spawning Marks of Grace [Explanation + Example] show the basics of force spawning marks of grace. However, we have since learned of the exact mechanics of spawning marks ( https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/Mark_of_grace#Obtaining_marks_of_grace ), allowing for the best possible method below. The method is stunningly simple: Every 3 to 9.5 minutes (inclusive, lower is better but don't be too quick) , do exactly one lap at Ardougne rooftops, then do other activities at your leisure. A mark of grace will spawn upon finishing the lap (and you will pick it up on your next lap) 75% of the time. When you are done, do one more lap (so a back to back lap to finish off) to grab the potential final mark. If no mark spawned on a certain lap don't panic, just keep to the rhythm. Using this strategy you get a mark of grace per 1057.3 xp on average at Ardougne, so that going from level 98 to 99 with this method gives approximately 1160 marks of grace or 2900 (4)-dose staminas (note: the real number is lower because of agility quest xp rewards collected after level 98) .",

      "description": "If you only went for one sceptre earlier, do Pyramid Plunder for a second sceptre. Compared to last time the only things that changed are: Use the teleport on your sceptre instead of entering the pyramid. You no longer need to hop for a North mummy. There is/was a bug where you have to leave the previous run instead of teleport out to avoid broken timers. The rooms change little: Room 7: loot the urns as you encounter them (south to north, then along the south wall around the chest). Open the doors clockwise starting east. If you're level 91 or above, make sure to go for chest when the timer hits around 2:10. Room 8: grab the east urns first, then trace back south and go clockwise. Grab the chest before or after the last urn and exit through the northeast open door. The most important trick to getting high xp and sceptre rates is not using the full 5 minutes per pp game - most of the time you should be getting laps of 4:40 or faster while opening all 81+ urns (and skipping urns in the second to last room if you can't keep this pace). This also means you'll run out of synch with other people playing PP, so while you can make use of information from doors others have opened for you (and skip them) while in the same room it's not going to be huge most of the time. Still open chests starting at level 51 room.",
